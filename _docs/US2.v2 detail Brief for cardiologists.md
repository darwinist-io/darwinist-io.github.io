### **Brief: Us2.v2 for Cardiologists**

Us2.v2 is an **AI-enhanced echocardiography** analysis solution developed by Us2.ai, designed to streamline and standardize adult transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) measurements. Below is a comprehensive overview tailored for cardiologists and echocardiography specialists:

---

## **1\. Core Purpose**

* **Automated Analysis:** Us2.v2 applies advanced AI algorithms to detect cardiac structures in 2D and Doppler images, then measures and reports over 45 echocardiographic parameters.  
* **Clinical Consistency:** By reducing manual measurements, Us2.v2 significantly lowers inter-reader variability and adheres to international reference guidelines (such as ASE recommendations), facilitating more uniform and reproducible results.

## **2\. Key Features and Measurements**

1. **Systolic Function**  
   * **Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (EF):** Automatically computed from biplane volumes (LVEDV, LVESV).  
   * **Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS):** Measures both **global** and **regional** strain to detect subtle contractile dysfunction.  
   * **TAPSE (Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion):** Evaluates RV systolic function.  
2. **Diastolic Function**  
   * **Mitral Inflow (E, A) and Tissue Doppler (e′, a′) Parameters:** Generates E/e′ ratios for estimating LV filling pressures.  
   * **Deceleration Time (DecT), A-wave Velocity, and Duration:** Offers insights into diastolic relaxation and compliance.  
3. **Structural Measurements**  
   * **Chamber Volumes & Dimensions:** LV, RV, LA, RA dimensions and volumes, computed in near real time.  
   * **Wall Thicknesses (IVSd, LVPWd):** Evaluates for hypertrophy or infiltrative disease.  
4. **Valvular Flow & Hemodynamics**  
   * **Aortic Valve Metrics:** Aortic valve area (AVA), velocity (Vmax), peak/mean gradients (Pmax, Pmean) for aortic stenosis assessment.  
   * **LVOT & Doppler:** LVOT diameter, velocity-time integral (VTI), and peak/mean gradients.  
   * **Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR) Velocity:** Helps estimate RV pressure load (e.g., in pulmonary hypertension).  
5. **Reporting & Editing**  
   * **Comprehensive Report Output:** Generates structured DICOM SR, PDF, or secondary capture summaries that integrate seamlessly with PACS.  
   * **Interactive Review:** Cardiologists and sonographers can revise or annotate the automatically generated measurements and visual markups.  
   * **Explainable AI:** Automated annotations and measurements are transparent, allowing clinicians to understand how values are derived.

## **3\. Workflow and Integration**

1. **Study Ingestion:** Us2.v2 accepts **DICOM** input from echocardiography machines, either directly or via existing PACS/routing.  
2. **Automated Processing:** Within 1 to 10 minutes—depending on data size and system configuration—Us2.v2 analyzes the study and produces measurements.  
3. **Report Generation:** The system outputs an editable echocardiography report, referencing international guidelines for validated parameters.  
4. **Compatibility:**  
   * **On-Premises or Cloud:** Deployable in hospital servers (including container-based environments such as Red Hat OpenShift) or in a secure cloud.  
   * **Healthcare Standards Support:** Integrates HL7 for EMR connectivity, DICOM SR for data exchange, and HIPAA-compliant data handling where required.

## **4\. Clinical and Operational Benefits**

1. **Time Savings & Efficiency**  
   * **Up to 70% Reduction in Exam Time:** Minimizes repetitive manual measurements, letting clinicians focus on patient care.  
   * **Faster Report Turnaround:** Automation accelerates interpretation and final reporting.  
2. **Improved Accuracy & Consistency**  
   * **Reduced Variability:** Standardized methodology lowers both intra- and inter-observer measurement discrepancies.  
   * **Guideline Alignment:** Incorporates ASE and other reference guidelines to maintain best practices.  
3. **Enhanced Diagnostic Confidence**  
   * **Strain Analysis:** Early detection of ischemic changes, cardiomyopathies, or chemo-induced cardiotoxicity.  
   * **Right-Heart Insights:** RV size and function parameters for potential pulmonary hypertension or right-sided heart failure.  
   * **Diastolic Function Metrics:** Quick assessment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), restrictive cardiomyopathy, and more.  
4. **Scalable Implementation**  
   * **Flexible Deployment Options:** On-premises data center, private/public cloud, or container orchestration platforms (e.g., OpenShift).  
   * **Enterprise Readiness:** Robust security features, role-based access, and enterprise integrations.

## **5\. Regulatory and Intended Use Notes**

* **Regulatory Clearances:**  
  * **FDA-Cleared:** Validated for **adult** transthoracic echocardiography.  
  * **Global Reach:** Approved or registered in multiple territories (e.g., EU, UK, Canada, Singapore, India, etc.).  
* **Intended Users:** Qualified cardiologists, sonographers, and other licensed healthcare professionals familiar with TTE.  
* **Scope Limits:** Us2.v2 is currently **not validated** for pediatric echo, transesophageal echo, intracardiac echo, or congenital heart disease. Some advanced valvular pathologies, pericardial disease, or intracardiac lesions may require additional dedicated studies.
