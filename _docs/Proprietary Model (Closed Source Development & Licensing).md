## **Proprietary Model (Closed Source Development & Licensing)**

1. **Utilization of Open Source Software Modules**

   * Proprietary software development often begins by leveraging open-source libraries, frameworks, and tools to reduce costs and accelerate development.  
   * These modules provide foundational functionality but do not dictate the openness of the final product.  
2. **Closed Application Development**

   * The development team builds proprietary features, integrations, and user experiences around the core modules.  
   * Access to the source code is restricted to internal teams, ensuring that intellectual property (IP) remains controlled.  
   * Security, performance, and unique value propositions are developed in-house without external contributions.  
3. **Software Licensing and Monetization**

   * The final product is sold through **perpetual licenses, subscription models, or SaaS offerings**.  
   * Customers pay for the right to use the software but do not have access to modify the source code.  
   * Additional revenue is generated through **maintenance contracts, updates, premium features, and enterprise editions**.  
   * Vendors maintain tight control over development, updates, and feature rollouts.  
4. **Business Strategy & Scaling**

   * Companies aim to create vendor lock-in, ensuring customers rely on their ecosystem.  
   * Profitability depends on selling software at scale while minimizing unauthorized distribution.  
   * Support is often included in licensing fees, but premium support and professional services can be sold separately.

## **Open Source Model (Collaborative Development & Support-Based Monetization)**

1. **Utilization of Open Source Software Modules**

   * The foundation of the product is built on **publicly available open-source components**.  
   * The company may contribute to these modules to enhance functionality, performance, and security.  
2. **Open Application Development with Community Collaboration**

   * Unlike proprietary software, development is conducted in the open, with external contributors, partners, and users participating.  
   * Companies may **lead the development but encourage community contributions**, allowing for faster iteration and innovation.  
   * Transparency fosters trust, and the community can help identify bugs, suggest improvements, and even contribute new features.  
3. **Software Packaging & Commercial Support Monetization**

   * Instead of selling software licenses, revenue is generated through:  
     * **Enterprise support contracts** (e.g., Red Hatâ€™s model)  
     * **Managed services and cloud hosting** (e.g., OpenShift, AWS supporting open-source tools)  
     * **Custom development and consulting services**  
     * **Premium features or enterprise add-ons** (dual licensing models)  
   * The software itself is freely available, but businesses pay for additional services and guarantees.  
4. **Business Strategy & Scaling**

   * The goal is to create a **large, engaged user base** that benefits from the open ecosystem while monetizing enterprise needs.  
   * Companies differentiate by offering stability, security hardening, and enterprise-grade features.  
   * Community contributions can reduce R\&D costs and accelerate innovation.  
   * Unlike proprietary models, open-source businesses often focus on **long-term relationships and service excellence** rather than license enforcement.

## **Key Differences & Trade-offs**

| Aspect | Proprietary Model | Open Source Model |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Code Access** | Closed, restricted | Open, accessible |
| **Development** | Internal teams only | Collaborative with community |
| **Revenue Model** | License sales, subscriptions | Support, cloud services, consulting |
| **Customer Lock-in** | High | Low (but brand loyalty can exist) |
| **Innovation Pace** | Slower, internal R\&D | Faster, crowdsourced contributions |
| **Cost of Development** | High (self-funded) | Lower (leveraging community) |
| **Security & Trust** | Controlled, but opaque | Transparent, but reliant on community best practices |
| **Market Strategy** | Vendor lock-in, high margins | Ecosystem-driven, recurring revenue |

## **Hybrid Approaches**

Many companies blend these models to **balance openness and profitability**:

* **Dual Licensing (e.g., MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Redis Enterprise)**  
  * Open-source community edition, but proprietary enterprise edition with extra features.  
* **Open Core Model (e.g., GitLab, HashiCorp)**  
  * Core features are open source, but enterprise enhancements require a paid license.  
* **Cloud-First Open Source (e.g., AWS RDS for MySQL/PostgreSQL, Red Hat OpenShift)**  
  * Software is open, but monetization happens through hosted services and enterprise support.
