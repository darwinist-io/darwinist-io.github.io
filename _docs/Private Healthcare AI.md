## Executive Summary

The future of healthcare AI lies in **Trust-specific large language models** fine-tuned on institutional knowledge and comprehensive patient data. This approach enables hospitals to develop private clinical AI systems that are deeply aligned with their specific practice environments, patient populations, and operational goals.

By fine-tuning models on complete clinical guidelines, historical EHR content, and real-world outcomes data, NHS Trusts can create powerful AI assistants that provide contextualized clinical decision support while maintaining full data control and auditability.
