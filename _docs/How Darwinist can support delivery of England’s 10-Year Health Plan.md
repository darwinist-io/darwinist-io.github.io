[The Government’s new 10-Year Health Plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/10-year-health-plan-for-england-fit-for-the-future/fit-for-the-future-10-year-health-plan-for-england-executive-summary) sets a bold direction: shift care from hospital to community, from analogue to digital, and from sickness to prevention. Darwinist’s pathway-centric platform maps neatly onto each of those three “radical shifts”, giving Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) and provider trusts practical tools they can deploy now.

### Hospital → Community

Move the centre of gravity from big acute hospitals to neighbourhood-based care. Care is delivered as locally as possible (home ➜ neighbourhood health centre ➜ hospital only when necessary), with multidisciplinary teams wrapped round the patient.

**The Darwinist platform enables delivery of digital health services to people at home via AI enabled pathways. Care teams and patients can communicate effectively via a formal clinical pathway process which guides the process, and records the delivery of care. New clinical pathways can be quickly created to support individual patients with comorbidities or chronic conditions.**

### Analogue → Digital

Replace paper, pagers and siloed IT with a single, interoperable digital spine. Patients get a “doctor in their pocket” via the NHS App and a unified health record; staff gain AI tools and automation that cut admin and surface real-time data. 

**Our platform is built on the FHIR open standard, with data being stored in FHIR databases. This design choice removes proprietary databases from the loop ensuring that a patient's record can be easily operated on by multiple systems.**

### Sickness → Prevention

Pivot the service from reacting to illness toward predicting and preventing it. Population health analytics, genomics, wearables and targeted public-health measures aim to keep people well for longer and narrow health inequalities.

**Darwinist enables wearable data the be easily ingested and stored, in FHIR, alongside the patient's medical records. Within our pathways, monitoring intervals can be set, ensuring that the patient's vitals are monitored. Medical data can be enriched with Patient questionnaires. Cohorts of patients can be easily configured enabling evidence based care of people at home on a national level.** 


### **Executive Summary**  

Darwinist’s AI enabled pathways put unprecedented power and flexibility in the hands of every NHS organisation. With Summary AI woven into each workflow, routine documentation and triage are generated automatically, so care can be delivered at a fraction of today’s cost while clinicians shed much of their administrative burden. Freed from cognitive overload, doctors and nurses make high-stakes decisions from a position of strength, armed with a complete, real-time appraisal of each patient’s data. Because the platform treats every algorithm as an approved AI medical device, intelligence is embedded at every step, from home monitoring to neighbourhood clinics to tertiary centres, unlocking radically better outcomes in any setting. This continuous, standards-based automation accelerates the NHS’s full digitisation and positions the UK to deliver the world’s most comprehensive, proactive and preventative healthcare \- by an exceptional margin.

### **From hospital to community: a FHIR-native backbone for the Neighbourhood Health Service (NHS²)**

* **Single longitudinal record wherever the patient is seen.** Darwinist’s Clinical Information System is built on FHIR UK Core from day one and manages the full patient record for just **£1 per patient per year** . That means community pharmacies, NHC teams and acute consultants are all reading and writing to the same structured dataset.

* **Rapid pathway development.** Local teams can stand up condition-specific workflows for example frailty or ADHD assessment without months of EPR re-configuration, supporting the Plan’s promise that **95 % of people with complex needs will hold a personalised care plan by 2027**.

* **Digital Front Door out-of-the-box.** A pre-built AI-triage “Digital Front Door” lets citizens self-refer or request advice through the NHS App, reducing the 8 a.m. GP scramble and routing demand to the neighbourhood team best placed to help .

### **From analogue to digital: turning the NHS App into a true “doctor in your pocket”**

* **FHIR & DICOM compliance guarantees plug-and-play integration.** Because the platform is **FHIR-native** and offers a **DicomWeb radiology module** , data flows straight into the single patient record the Plan demands.

* **AI-powered documentation cuts admin by 30 %.** The Summary AI module generates clinician-validated discharge letters and care-plan updates, trimming paperwork and cognitive load .

* **Measured productivity gains.** Live sites report **70 % faster triage** and **30 % less admin** for frontline teams, freeing capacity to deliver the digital services citizens now expect .

* **AI Functions as Medical Devices (AiFMD).** Trusts can author and audit their own LLM-powered decision-support “skills” under the health-institution exemption, with full version control and safety governance —exactly the kind of safe AI deployment envisioned in the Plan’s ambition to make the NHS “the most AI-enabled health system in the world”.

### **From sickness to prevention: data-driven, proactive care**

* **Pathway analytics identify risk early.** Because every observation, condition and intervention is stored as discrete FHIR resources, ICBs can run population-health queries that flag deterioration before an emergency admission.

* **Composable wearables workflows.** Device readings land in the same record, ready for rule-based alerts; that supports the Plan’s goal of making wearables “standard in preventative, chronic and post-acute treatment by 2035”.

* **Low marginal cost encourages scale.** The pay-as-you-go model—**£1 per patient per pathway**, with optional AI and imaging add-ons—keeps prevention business cases inside tender thresholds, speeding procurement.
