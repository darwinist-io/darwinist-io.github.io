**Product Brief: Visiba Red Robin**

#### **Overview**

Visiba provides advanced, AI-powered solutions for healthcare settings, focusing on patient triage and clinical workflow optimization. At the core of their offering is **Red Robin**, an automated anamnesis and triage system, designed to enhance efficiency, improve patient outcomes, and reduce costs in healthcare systems.

#### **Core Features and Capabilities**

1. **Patient Triage System**  
   * Collects demographic and symptom data via free text input from patients.  
   * Utilizes a probabilistic Bayesian model to analyze responses and determine potential diagnoses dynamically.  
   * Does not rely on static pathways, adjusting probabilities in real-time based on patient answers.  
   * Patients can submit multiple presenting complaints for comprehensive assessments.  
2. **AI-Powered Technology**  
   * **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Maps patient input to approximately 1,000 nodes representing symptoms, diagnoses, or risk factors.  
   * **Dynamic Questioning:** Adapts questions to refine diagnostic probabilities and triage levels, typically asking about 18 tailored questions per session.  
   * **Probabilistic Graphical Network:** Integrates symptoms, diagnoses, and risk factors for accurate decision-making.  
3. **Seamless Integration**  
   * Quick plug-and-play setup with customer systems such as EHRs, telephony platforms, and web portals.  
   * Modular architecture allows for customization to suit diverse healthcare environments.  
   * Uses a limited number of API endpoints to streamline integration.  
4. **Regulatory Compliance and Data Protection**  
   * Class 2A MDR-certified product for safe deployment in healthcare settings.  
   * Avoids storing identifiable patient data, ensuring compliance with stringent data protection regulations.  
   * Patient authentication is managed entirely by customer systems.  
5. **Triage and Navigation Outputs**  
   * Provides an **urgency level** (scaled 1-8) and a **list of differential diagnoses** with probabilities.  
   * Supports rules-based logic for care navigation, directing patients to appropriate services via API calls or self-service URLs.  
   * Includes safety features for escalation, such as handling repeat callers.  
6. **UX and Patient Interaction**  
   * Allows patients to indicate uncertainty in responses for more accurate triage.  
   * Collects time and trend data, including recurrence for chronic symptoms like headaches, to understand condition progression.  
7. **Clinical Decision Support**  
   * Offers detailed patient summaries to clinicians, including suggested diagnoses and explanations.  
   * Visualizes diagnostic probabilities using a color-coded scale (e.g., dark blue to yellow for likelihood).  
   * Real-time clinician feedback refines system accuracy and ensures transparency in decision-making.  
8. **Deployment and Scalability**  
   * Kubernetes-based platform enables deployment on containerized solutions like OpenShift.  
   * Supports telephony integration, exemplified in partnerships like Adastra in the UK.  
   * Optimized for translation and market-specific adaptations, typically requiring 3-6 months for new regions.

#### **Market Applications**

1. **Acute and Primary Care**  
   * Focuses on triage for new or acute symptoms rather than chronic conditions.  
   * Piloted in Sweden for social services and elderly home care, reducing professional intervention requirements.  
2. **Pre-Service Triage**  
   * Piloted in NHS England for pre-service triage to streamline patient navigation and reduce healthcare system burdens (e.g., 50% reduction in GP appointments).  
3. **Future Expansions**  
   * Chronic care pathways and mental health triage are under exploration.  
   * Plans for follow-up triage to integrate previous episodes and patient histories.  
4. **Global Reach**  
   * Deployed in Nordic countries, with entry into the UK healthcare system via the NHS.  
   * Exploring U.S. market entry, pending FDA approval and exclusivity agreements.

#### **Technology and Infrastructure**

* Built on a **probabilistic graphical network** for dynamic assessments.  
* Uses **AI-powered image analysis** for assisting in diagnoses.  
* Collaborates with Red Hat and IBM to explore insurance-driven opportunities.  
* Operates on Kubernetes for flexibility and scalability.

#### **Outcomes and Benefits**

* **Efficiency Gains:** Demonstrated reduction in system costs and healthcare appointments.  
* **Enhanced Patient Flow:** Improves navigation through healthcare pathways.  
* **AI-Driven Transparency:** Emphasizes explainable AI to foster clinician trust.  
* **Scalable and Adaptable:** Modular design allows quick adaptation to market-specific needs and future use cases.

#### **Vision and Roadmap**

Visiba aims to become a versatile, global triage platform that adapts to diverse healthcare pathways. Current plans include:

* Expanding chronic care and mental health applications.  
* Enhancing follow-up session capabilities.  
* Extending global reach within 24 months with necessary regulatory adaptations.  
* Strengthening partnerships in insurance-driven and global markets.

#### **Conclusion**

Visibaâ€™s **Red Robin** is a cutting-edge AI solution for healthcare, designed to optimize triage, enhance patient outcomes, and streamline clinical workflows. Its focus on transparency, compliance, and adaptability positions it as a leader in the evolving healthcare technology landscape.
