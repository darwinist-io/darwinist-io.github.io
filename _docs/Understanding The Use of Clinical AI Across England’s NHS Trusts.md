excerpt: "A comprehensive study examining clinical AI adoption across 120 NHS trusts in England, revealing a 50% adoption rate with radiology and neurology leading implementation efforts."
---


Clinical artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape diagnostic and treatment workflows across England’s NHS trusts. This report examines the current state of adoption, procurement, and governance practices as of late 2024, based on Freedom of Information (FOI) responses from 120 trusts. 

The findings reveal a 50% adoption rate of clinical AI tools among respondents. Radiology and neurology are the areas with the greatest penetration, particularly for diagnostic imaging. A total of 36 different AI providers were cited, with stroke support platforms Brainomix and iSchemaView RapidAI emerging as the most widely deployed.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were by far the most prevalent type of AI reported, with only a handful of trusts using Large Language Model (LLM) based tools.

While usage statistics were inconsistently reported, available data indicates that adoption is mostly limited to small scale pilot projects, although higher usage rates are observed in fracture detection and mammography support tools.

Procurement and governance practices were fragmented: with some trusts establishing internal steering groups, while others relied on Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) or regional networks for decision-making. 

A large percentage of trusts remain in the early stages of adoption, with small-scale trials and policy development still ongoing. Nevertheless, a growing number of public announcements since the study's completion underscores the accelerating momentum behind clinical AI adoption in the NHS.

In order to further understand the level of adoption of clinical AI adoption across the NHS in England, Darwinist has conducted this study, using the results of a Freedom of Information request designed to provide a more thorough vision of the current clinical AI landscape.

On the 18th September 2024, we sent out FOI requests to 149 NHS trusts asking for details regarding any clinical AI tools that were currently being utilised in the trust, as well as details on the usage frequency, and copies of any policies, procedures or committee notes regarding the approval, procurement and implementation processes for clinical AI. 120 trusts responded to the FOI request, and 29 did not. Ambulance and mental health trusts were not contacted, 

Perhaps as was to be expected given the independent nature of trusts, there was significant variation in clinical AI adoption across the country, mirroring the lack of uniformity that is present across other elements of England’s socialised healthcare landscape. Responses were split exactly down the middle, with 60 trusts indicating they were using clinical AI, and 60 trusts explicitly saying they were not. Each of the 12 community trusts that were contacted confirmed that they had not implemented any clinical AI.

There was a significant lack of standardisation in how the trusts reported across the responses, in terms of both the depth of information and specificity of details provided. Despite this, we are able to ascertain a strong idea of the main providers of clinical AI products, and the general area their products operate in, and whilst the inconsistency of the data makes it difficult to fully understand wider patterns regarding the exact modalities and pathologies being addressed, there is still enough information present to understand how AI is being implemented in the following clinical workflows.

* Stroke Detection \- Brainomix and iSchemaView RapidAI are widely used for acute stroke diagnosis and care.

* Chest Imaging \- Annalise, Behold AI Red Dot, Aidence Veye, and other AI tools are used for triaging chest CTs and x-rays, detecting and flagging abnormalities.

* Fracture Detection and Bone Age \- Systems such as Gleamer BoneView, Radiobotics RB fracture, and BoneXpert, appear in orthopaedic workflows.

* Cardiovascular Imaging \- HeartFlow and Circle CVI are used for cardiac image analysis.

* Dermatology \- Skin Analytics DERM product is being used in teledermatology triage, helping to flag suspicious lesions for dermatologist review.

* Radiotherapy \- Tools like RaySearch Laboratories RayStation and Limbus AI are being used in radiotherapy for contouring and treatment planning.

* Image Reconstruction \- Scanner-specific tools such as Siemens Deep Resolve and Canon AICE are being used to reconstruct MRI images and check scan quality.

Additionally there was some sporadic reporting of communicative AI tools, such as Nuance Speechmagic for medical transcription, and the creation of patient information videos via Synesthesia. However, these types of tools may not be considered as clinical AI as defined in our request, and as such, a number of trusts may not have reported their usage..

There were a total of 36 different vendors reported, with neurology providers Brainomix and iSchemaView Rapid AI having the largest footprint. Across the trusts, radiology saw the highest level of penetration, and although there was sporadic usage of Large Language Models (LLMS), the vast majority of tools are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based algorithms offering diagnostic imaging support.

Many trusts were unable to provide core statistics regarding their usage of clinical AI, with a number of them saying they do not keep this information on record. However, a significant number of responding trusts indicated that they were in the process of trialling clinical AI tools, which may account for part of the current unavailability of usage statistics.

Of the trusts who did provide details, there was a lack of standardisation in the data reported, with data often copied into pdf files. This made it difficult to accurately collate the statistics and build a holistic view of the true use and impact of the current deployments of clinical AI tools. In hindsight, however, we should have been more specific in our request and provided trusts with more guidance in how to deliver statistics. Despite this, we are still able to project that in general, base usage numbers for the majority of clinically deployed AI applications are relatively low. 

Following the trend of fragmentation across the different trusts, there was a range of responses to the question of existing clinical AI policies, guidelines and frameworks. Some trusts did not have any sort of policies or procedures in place. Others are currently running pilot projects to assess the validity of clinical AI tools, and a number of trusts note that these trials have been procured and implemented in their trust through region wide initiatives orchestrated by integrated care boards (ICBs) or collaborative systems such as regional stroke or imaging networks.

In addition to this reliance on regional bodies, a significant portion of responders said they are in the process of drafting trust specific frameworks and policies regarding the use of clinical AI. A small number of trusts indicate that they have AI steering groups or AI governance boards set up to oversee the selection and approval of clinical AI tools.

A recurring theme is that the AI approval process often overlaps with general digital governance committees and policies. Trusts are referring to traditional guidelines and frameworks such as DTAC (Digital Technology Assessment Criteria) and “A Buyer’s Guide to AI in Health and Care” as part of their clinical AI NHS assessment protocols. 

This report is designed to be a snapshot of the clinical AI landscape in the NHS in late 2024, and as such, the data will not be fully representative of the picture today. In the six months since we sent our requests, numerous public announcements have appeared regarding the adoption of clinical AI, including from trusts who indicated they were not using them in this study. A key driver for this uptick in adoption may be the recent success of vendors like Annalise, who have signed deals to roll out their chest x-ray solution across a number of regional imaging networks.

Despite a number of trusts conducting clinical AI pilots, we have uncovered a number of factors which appear to be blocking adoption at scale. Andrew Davies note about 13%

**Weak Business Cases**

CNNs are single task tools focusing on a specific pathology and modality, and their results cannot currently be used for diagnosis without the oversight of a clinical professional. It is unlikely that in the near future clinical AI tools will be authorised to independently diagnose patients, which drastically reduces their ability to present compelling business cases.

Whilst there is supplier led evidence which attempts to outline the cost and time benefits of using AI tools, it does not appear yet that sufficient NHS led benefits realisation and evaluation has been conducted to give concrete indications on the ROI of adopting clinical AI.

**The Individuality of Trusts**

Each trust requires an AI tool to work in its own specific data environment and must conduct its own safety and technical testing within that environment. This means that there is no one turnkey solution, and repeatable patterns cannot be uniformly deployed across the country.

Despite this need for bespoke implementations, there are still lessons that can be shared between trusts. However, there is no national NHS AI implementation blueprint to refer to, and trusts who are successfully piloting clinical AI are not currently efficiently documenting their process for others to learn from.

There also remains a vast difference in the levels of digital maturity of trusts, meaning some trusts simply do not have the infrastructure in place to be able to adopt clinical AI.

**Lack of Clarity on Liability** 

There are concerns regarding the clarification of the legal liabilities of using AI, especially regarding who is responsible in the case of an AI making an error which leads to patient harm. 

We believe that the clinician remains the liability sponge, and is ultimately responsible for making medical decisions based on information provided by an AI. Clinical AI tools cannot currently be used to autonomously diagnose patients.

**Uncertainty Over Long Term Performance**

The small scale proof of concept trials conducted by trusts are valuable in validating that an AI tool works within their own IT architecture and with their own datasets, but it is unclear how much thought has been given to after marketing monitoring, on both the trust and vendors sides. Ensuring that an AI model behaves consistently over a longer period of time is essential for patient safety, and reinstalling retrained AI models puts unnecessary technical burden on a trust.

**Resistance to Change**

There is understandable reticence amongst some radiologists to adopt tools which are perceived to be a threat to their jobs. Whilst in the short to medium term, clinical AI tools simply augment a clinician’s existing workflows, there may potentially be a future in which diagnostic AI are cleared to diagnose patients without human supervision, which creates an existential threat to the radiological profession. 

However, it may well be the case that radiologists are prime candidates to become the experts in clinical AI. 

**Knowledge and Training Deficits**

On both an individual and institutional level, a lot of trusts currently lack the necessary expertise to properly evaluate and implement clinical AI.

Successful AI implementation also requires a coordinated effort between clinicians, information governance, IT, digital transformation, and clinical safety teams. 

There have been concerns raised regarding the quality of data that is being used to train AI models, particularly LLMs. It is true that the standard of medical report keeping is highly inconsistent across trusts, and inputs used for training AI models must be closely vetted for accuracy. However, we must be careful not to place an unrealistic expectation on new AI technologies. 

It would be a fallacy to suggest that AI adoption should be blocked because it either cannot achieve perfection in an imperfect data scenario, or requires perfect data to be able to be efficient. Clinicians also operate in a world of imperfect data, and we believe that the usefulness of AI should be measured against existing human standards rather than the expectation of perfection.

We can envisage a future where by 2035, every clinical interaction will be touched by AI in some form. Whilst CNN models are clinically valuable but limited in their scope, Darwinist believes that LLM based solutions have the potential to touch every branch of medicine. However, we believe that the clinical use of LLMs must follow the same pattern as that of radiology CNNs, with oversight from a trained clinician still being required.

We believe that LLMs have the greatest potential impact in the field of mental health. To prove this hypothesis, Darwinist is beginning a small scale trial with Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber NHS Foundation Trust to implement an LLM based AI solution which transforms complex longitudinal patient data into succinct, actionable clinical reports.

We believe that the only way for this to be clinically viable is for a trained medical professional to validate the AI inputs and outputs to ensure clinical relevance and transparency. Current black box LLM models do not offer explainable decision making processes, and as such, cannot provide outputs which can safely be used in clinical settings. 

In this instance, the LLM itself is not necessarily classed as a medical device. However, the viewer through which a clinician can collate and process patient information using the AI likely will be. Darwinist is developing such a viewer to work alongside the LLM. 

In order to ensure that clinicians can validate the quality input data being used to generate reports, we have developed a traffic light grading scheme in collaboration with the Professional Records Standards Body. This system assigns a score to longitudinal patient data to provide clinicians with a reference for the record keeping standards of the trust requesting the report.

To support clinicians in their journey to becoming experts in clinical AI practice, Continual Personal Development certifications will be designed and delivered in collaboration with leading universities and the Royal Colleges of Medicine.

Would also be interesting to know why the momentum isn't there in community and primary care? is it that they don't have the digital support the same?

It’s a very hazy line between the AI that’s happening on the scanner \- and AI that’s happening off scanner…… 

Patient record summary can be used clinically for diagnosis and treatment.

It’s not a golden bullet. 

## **Data stored at rest in FHIR is the gold standard.**

1\. Data Quality & Variability

* Inconsistent Clinical Data: Data input (e.g. from HSC, GPs) often includes idiosyncrasies, shorthand, and context-specific notes that are hard for AI to interpret.

* Global Inconsistencies: Medical acronyms and coding vary significantly across countries, impacting model generalisability.

---

3\. Safety, Governance & Legal Hurdles

* Clinical Safety Concerns: Many implementations lack proper clinical safety assessments or dual-running phases to learn safely.

* Information Governance (IG) Issues: Governance challenges make data sharing and implementation complex.

### **Conclusion**

Across the NHS in England, the use of clinical AI is increasingly becoming more common. As of the time of this study, 50% of trusts reported some level of usage, with all indications that this number has grown steadily since. Diagnostic imaging tools are leading the way, with the fields of radiology and neurology seeing notable adoption. However, the NHS is still early in its clinical AI journey, with a large number of trusts still conducting pilot studies or yet to touch it at all. The governance and procurement landscape is also yet to crystalise, and whilst a more coherent adoption pattern may emerge over time, the current picture is one of localised innovation rather than nationwide coherence.

Below is a list of the responses provided by the NHS Trusts. The level of detail provided reflects that of the trust’s response.
