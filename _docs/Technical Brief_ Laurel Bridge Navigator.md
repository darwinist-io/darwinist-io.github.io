## **Technical Brief: Laurel Bridge Navigator**

### **1\. Product Overview**

Laurel Bridge **Navigator** is a robust and highly configurable **DICOM workflow orchestration platform** that automates the **retrieval and movement of prior imaging studies (priors)** in clinical environments. It integrates seamlessly with legacy and modern imaging systems, solving the challenges of **interfacing, fetching, filtering, and routing DICOM objects** across distributed networks and multiple systems.

It operates as a **middleware application** to fetch relevant historical imaging studies, based on configurable workflows triggered by real-time events like HL7 messages, RESTful API calls, or DICOM MWL queries.

---

### **2\. Core Capabilities**

#### **2.1 Priors Fetching Automation**

Navigator automatically identifies, filters, and transfers relevant prior exams for new imaging studies. The fetching logic is based on user-defined criteria and system-defined workflows.

#### **2.2 Workflow-Driven Architecture**

Navigator uses a modular architecture comprised of:

* **Triggers** (MWL, HL7, RESTful, CSV)  
* **Rules** (conditional logic for when to act)  
* **Sources** (DICOM Q/R SCPs)  
* **Destinations** (DICOM Store SCPs)  
* **Workflows** (define what to fetch and where to send it)

Each component is independently configurable, allowing fine-grained control over the data flow and behavior.

---

### **3\. System Architecture**

#### **3.1 Components**

* **Navigator Service:** Windows Service that handles the backend logic.  
* **Navigator Web UI:** Web-based configuration and monitoring interface.  
* **SQL Server Database:** Stores all configuration and runtime metadata.  
* **DICOM Engine:** Handles C-FIND, C-MOVE, and C-STORE services.

#### **3.2 Deployment**

* Supports **Windows 10, Server 2012 R2+**.  
* Requires **Microsoft SQL Server 2012+** (Express or full).  
* Can run on **dedicated hardware or virtual machines**.  
* TLS support for **secure DICOM, HL7, and Web communications**.  
* **LDAP/Active Directory** support for enterprise authentication.

### **4\. Trigger Types**

| Trigger Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **MWL** | Periodically queries Modality Worklist SCPs and converts results into workflow events. |
| **HL7** | Listens for inbound HL7 messages and converts them into trigger events. |
| **RESTful** | Accepts REST API calls to create dynamic workflow triggers. |
| **CSV** | Monitors folders for CSV files and ingests rows as trigger events. |

Each trigger supports:

* **Advanced duplicate detection**  
* **Custom property mapping**  
* **TLS and secure transmission options**

---

### **5\. Rule Engine**

Rules define conditions that must be satisfied for a workflow to be created. Conditions can use:

* Trigger type/name  
* Common properties  
* Raw HL7/DICOM/REST/CSV data  
* Schedule/time-based logic  
* Custom scripts

Rules are processed **top-down**, and can optionally stop on first match to optimize performance.

---

### **6\. Workflow Execution**

#### **6.1 Priors Workflows**

The central concept in Navigator. Each priors workflow:

* Specifies **which Sources** to query.  
* Applies **filtering logic** to narrow down relevant priors.  
* Defines **Destinations** to which selected priors are sent.  
* Uses **custom C\# scripts** to handle complex decisions.  
* Supports **date-based constraints** (e.g., sliding date windows).  
* Can be configured to **fail or continue** on partial success.

#### **6.2 Move Requests**

Navigator sends DICOM C-MOVE commands from Source to Destination, monitors their success, and logs detailed results.

* Not subject to PCI standards  
* No service backdoors or unauthorized access mechanisms

---

### **9\. Troubleshooting and Maintenance**

* Automatic crash recovery and service restarts  
* Generates crash dumps for diagnostic use  
* PowerShell scripts for TLS configuration and hardening  
* Dashboard view provides a system health summary  
* Detailed views for trigger events, workflows, and move operations

---

### **10\. Licensing and Scalability**

* License enforces limits on:  
  * Number of Triggers  
  * Rules  
  * Workflows  
  * Sources/Destinations

* No hardcoded limits unless defined in the license

Radiologists require previous imaging exams (priors) for comparison when reading current studies. Manual retrieval is time-consuming and error-prone, especially when images reside in disparate PACS or archives.

### **Navigator Solution:**

* Use **HL7 ORU messages or MWL triggers** to detect newly scheduled or acquired imaging exams.  
* Apply **custom Rules and Priors Workflows** to identify relevant prior studies.  
* Automatically query legacy PACS and move matched priors to the radiologist’s **primary workstation or PACS**.  
* Filter priors by **modality, body part, or exam date range** to ensure relevance.

### **Benefits:**

* Eliminates manual fetching tasks.  
* Reduces interpretation delays.  
* Ensures prior studies are available at the time of reading.
