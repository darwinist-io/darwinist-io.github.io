### **Costly Lessons: A History of the UK’s Biggest Healthcare IT Procurement Failures**

### **1\. National Programme for IT (NPfIT) – £10 Billion+**

* **Timeframe**: Launched in 2002, abandoned in 2011\.  
* **What happened**: The NPfIT was an ambitious project aimed at digitizing the NHS, including electronic patient records, national databases, and IT infrastructure standardization.  
* **Why it failed**:  
  * Lack of stakeholder engagement (clinicians weren’t consulted).  
  * Overly centralized approach with rigid top-down control.  
  * Contracts were awarded to large IT vendors (like CSC and Fujitsu) who struggled with NHS complexities.  
  * Technical difficulties and delays.  
* **Money wasted**: Estimated over **£10 billion**, making it one of the most expensive IT failures in UK history.

### **2\. Care.data – £100 Million+**

* **Timeframe**: Launched in 2013, scrapped in 2016\.  
* **What happened**: The Care.data program aimed to collect patient data from GPs and hospitals to improve research and NHS efficiency.  
* **Why it failed**:  
  * Poor communication with the public, leading to privacy concerns.  
  * Patients were not properly informed about data sharing opt-out options.  
  * Data security concerns regarding commercial third-party access.  
* **Money wasted**: Over **£100 million**, with no tangible benefits.

### **3\. e-Borders (Home Office/NHS Border Control Health Screening) – £830 Million**

* **Timeframe**: 2003-2010.  
* **What happened**: Although not purely NHS-related, e-Borders was meant to improve health screening for foreign nationals entering the UK.  
* **Why it failed**:  
  * Severe delays and contract disputes with IT suppliers.  
  * System failed to integrate properly with NHS health checks.  
* **Money wasted**: An estimated **£830 million** in costs before cancellation.

### **4\. Lorenzo (Electronic Patient Record System) – £4.7 Billion**

* **Timeframe**: 2004-2013.  
* **What happened**: Part of NPfIT, Lorenzo was meant to be the flagship NHS electronic patient record (EPR) system.  
* **Why it failed**:  
  * Poor usability, leading to clinician resistance.  
  * Software development delays.  
  * Trusts opted for alternative EPR solutions.  
* **Money wasted**: Approximately **£4.7 billion**, as NHS trusts abandoned it.

### **5\. NHSmail (Email System) – £90 Million**

* **Timeframe**: 2004-2016.  
* **What happened**: NHSmail was meant to provide a secure and efficient email system for NHS staff.  
* **Why it failed**:  
  * System was outdated before full rollout.  
  * Staff found it slow and difficult to use.  
* **Money wasted**: Roughly **£90 million** before switching to Office 365\.

### **6\. BT's Spine Upgrade Failure – £400 Million**

* **Timeframe**: Early 2010s.  
* **What happened**: The NHS Spine project was designed to handle electronic prescriptions, patient summaries, and appointment scheduling.  
* **Why it failed**:  
  * BT underestimated the complexity and NHS-wide needs.  
  * Cost overruns led to contract disputes.  
* **Money wasted**: An estimated **£400 million**.

### **7\. NHS 111 IT System (Outsourced Call Handling) – £50+ Million**

* **Timeframe**: 2013-present (with ongoing issues).  
* **What happened**: The NHS 111 service, meant to replace NHS Direct, suffered from poor IT implementation.  
* **Why it failed**:  
  * System frequently crashed, delaying urgent care.  
  * Lack of integration with GP and hospital records.  
* **Money wasted**: **£50+ million**, with ongoing costs to fix issues.

### **8\. E-referrals System (Choose and Book replacement) – £356 Million**

* **Timeframe**: 2014-2018.  
* **What happened**: A new electronic referral service was supposed to replace Choose and Book.  
* **Why it failed**:  
  * Overcomplicated system design.  
  * Low adoption by GPs due to usability issues.  
* **Money wasted**: **£356 million**, as many NHS trusts stuck with old methods.

### **9\. GP at Hand (Babylon Partnership with NHS) – £250+ Million**

* **Timeframe**: 2018-present.  
* **What happened**: Digital-first GP services with AI-powered consultations were promoted as the future of NHS primary care.  
* **Why it failed**:  
  * System prioritized young, healthy patients while traditional GPs were left to manage more complex cases.  
  * Regulatory concerns over patient safety and AI-driven decision-making.  
* **Money wasted**: Estimated **£250 million**, as expansion slowed and traditional GP services had to compensate.

* **What happened**: The NHS Covid-19 app was meant to help with pandemic contact tracing.  
* **Why it failed**:  
  * Initial app (NHSX) scrapped after Apple-Google API issues.  
  * Poor adoption due to privacy concerns.  
  * Lack of effectiveness in preventing outbreaks.  
* **Money wasted**: While the **app itself cost £12 million**, the wider **Test and Trace** program cost **£37 billion**, with minimal impact on controlling the pandemic.

### **Key Takeaways**

* **Centralized, top-down NHS IT programs often fail due to lack of clinician involvement.**  
* **Large IT vendors frequently underestimate NHS complexity, leading to delays and ballooning costs.**  
* **Security, privacy, and usability concerns often doom public health IT projects.**  
* **Fragmented procurement means NHS trusts often seek alternative solutions, making national projects redundant.**
