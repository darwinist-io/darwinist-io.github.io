# Document Format Guide for AI Content Generation

## YAML Front Matter Structure

Every document must begin with YAML front matter enclosed in triple dashes (`---`). This metadata controls how Jekyll processes and displays the document:

```yaml
---
layout: document                    # Always use "document" layout
title: "Primary Document Title"     # Clear, descriptive title
subtitle: "Explanatory subtitle"    # Additional context (optional)
date: 2025-06-01                   # Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
author: "Darwinist Team"           # Always "Darwinist Team"
tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"]     # Relevant keywords as array
category: "Category Name"          # Groups related documents
featured: true                     # Boolean: highlights important docs
toc: true                         # Boolean: enables table of contents
hidden: false                     # Boolean: hides from document listing
excerpt: "Brief summary..."       # 1-2 sentence document description
---
```

### YAML Field Guidelines:

- **title**: Use title case, be specific and descriptive
- **subtitle**: Explain the document's purpose or scope
- **tags**: Include 3-7 relevant keywords (healthcare tech, product names, standards)
- **category**: Use consistent categories like "Healthcare Technology", "Medical AI Solutions", "Healthcare Infrastructure"
- **excerpt**: Write a compelling 1-2 sentence summary highlighting key benefits, metrics, or unique value

## Markdown Heading Structure

Use ATX-style headings with proper hierarchy:

```markdown
# Main Title (H1) - Use sparingly, mainly for document title
## Major Section (H2) - Primary content divisions
### Subsection (H3) - Secondary topics
#### Details (H4) - Specific points
##### Minor Points (H5) - Rarely used
###### Smallest (H6) - Avoid if possible
```

### Heading Best Practices:
- Start with H2 for main content sections (H1 reserved for document title)
- Maintain logical hierarchy (don't skip levels)
- Use descriptive, scannable headings
- Include keywords relevant to healthcare/technology context

## Content Formatting

### Emphasis and Strong Text
```markdown
*Italics for emphasis*
**Bold for strong importance**
***Bold and italic for critical points***
```

### Lists
```markdown
# Unordered lists for features, benefits, capabilities
* Primary point
* Secondary point
  * Nested sub-point
  * Another sub-point

# Ordered lists for processes, steps, phases
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

### Code and Technical Elements
```markdown
`Inline code` for technical terms, file names, commands

```
Code blocks for longer technical content, configurations, or examples
```

### Links
```markdown
[External link text](https://example.com)
[This AI Spec Document]({% link _docs/AI spec.md %})
```

### Tables
```markdown
| Feature | Benefit | Use Case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Row 1 data | Row 1 data | Row 1 data |
| Row 2 data | Row 2 data | Row 2 data |
```

### Blockquotes
```markdown
> Use for important quotes, key statistics, or highlighted information
```

## Document Structure Pattern

Most healthcare technology documents follow this structure:

```markdown
# Executive Summary or Overview
Brief introduction explaining what the technology/solution does and its primary value proposition.

## Key Features/Capabilities
Detailed breakdown of main functionalities, often using:
- Bullet points for feature lists
- Numbered lists for processes
- Tables for comparisons

## Technical Specifications
- System requirements
- Integration capabilities
- Standards compliance
- Architecture details

## Use Cases/Applications
Real-world scenarios where the solution provides value, often organized by:
- Healthcare setting (NHS Trusts, private practices, etc.)
- Clinical specialty (radiology, cardiology, etc.)
- Workflow type (diagnostic, therapeutic, administrative)

## Benefits/Outcomes
Quantified results, metrics, and qualitative improvements:
- Clinical outcomes
- Operational efficiency
- Cost savings
- User satisfaction

## Implementation/Deployment
- Setup requirements
- Integration process
- Training needs
- Support available

## Compliance/Security
- Regulatory certifications
- Data protection measures
- Healthcare standards compliance
- Audit capabilities

## Conclusion
Summary of key value propositions and call to action
```

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone and Voice
- **Professional but accessible**: Avoid overly technical jargon without explanation
- **Confident and authoritative**: Present information as factual and well-researched
- **Solution-focused**: Emphasize benefits and outcomes for healthcare organizations
- **UK healthcare context**: Reference NHS, NICE, CQC, and UK regulations where relevant

### Technical Writing Best Practices
- Define acronyms on first use: "Electronic Health Record (EHR)"
- Use active voice when possible
- Include specific metrics and quantified benefits
- Provide context for technical capabilities (why they matter clinically)
- Use consistent terminology throughout

### Healthcare-Specific Considerations
- Reference relevant UK healthcare standards (HL7 FHIR, DICOM, etc.)
- Include regulatory compliance information (CE marking, MHRA approval, etc.)
- Mention integration with common NHS systems
- Address clinical workflow implications
- Consider different user types (clinicians, IT staff, administrators)

## Special Formatting Elements

### Callout Boxes (using blockquotes with formatting)
```markdown
> **Key Benefit**: This solution reduces diagnostic time by 70% while improving accuracy.
```

### Feature Lists with Icons
```markdown
‚úÖ **FHIR Compliant**: Native support for healthcare interoperability standards
‚ùå **Legacy Compatible**: Works with existing PACS and HIS systems
üîí **Secure**: End-to-end encryption and GDPR compliance
```

### Comparison Tables
```markdown
| Capability | Our Solution | Traditional Approach |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Setup Time | Minutes | Weeks |
| Standards | FHIR/DICOM | Proprietary |
| Access | Cloud/On-Premise | On-Premise Only |
```

## Common Document Categories

- **"Healthcare Technology"**: General health IT solutions
- **"Medical AI Solutions"**: AI-powered diagnostic and clinical tools
- **"Healthcare Infrastructure"**: Core systems like PACS, imaging networks
- **"Healthcare Standards"**: Documentation about FHIR, DICOM, HL7
- **"Healthcare Policy"**: Analysis of regulations, procurement, strategy
- **"Medical Imaging Solutions"**: Radiology and imaging-specific tools
- **"Healthcare Education"**: Training and certification frameworks

## SEO and Discoverability

- Include relevant keywords naturally in headings and content
- Use descriptive link text
- Structure content for scanning (headings, lists, tables)
- Include quantified benefits and outcomes
- Reference popular healthcare technology terms and standards

## File Naming Convention

Files should use descriptive names with spaces and proper capitalization:
- `Product Name Technical Brief.md`
- `Healthcare Standard Implementation Guide.md`
- `Clinical AI Solution Overview.md`

This format ensures consistency, readability, and proper Jekyll processing while serving the needs of healthcare technology professionals seeking detailed, actionable information.
