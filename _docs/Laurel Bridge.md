# Laurel Bridge

Integrated DICOM Routing and Radiology AI Orchestration for NHS Radiology Departments

## **üìå Executive Summary**

Laurel Bridge is an advanced, next-generation medical imaging orchestration platform that integrates the robust routing capabilities of Compass with the automated prior retrieval and workflow orchestration of Navigator, purpose-built to meet the clinical, technical, and regulatory needs of NHS Trust Radiology Departments.

Designed for seamless integration with Radiology AI algorithms and NHS PACS/RIS infrastructure, Beagle serves as a central control plane for all DICOM-based data movement, ensuring secure, intelligent, and automated imaging workflows across legacy and modern systems.

## **üß† Key Capabilities**

### **1\. Unified DICOM Routing and AI Workflow Management**

* Consolidates Compass' DICOM routing engine and Navigator's prior-fetch logic into a single platform.  
* Enables AI-ready workflows, directing exams to AI inference engines, RIS/PACS, and storage archives in parallel or sequentially.  
* Flexible support for Store and Forward and Direct routing logic with multi-destination orchestration.

### **2\. Radiology AI Integration Framework**

* Routes studies to AI analysis platforms based on modality, body part, patient demographics, or referring physician.  
  Supports round-trip workflows: ingestion ‚Üí AI analysis ‚Üí results returned as DICOM SR, PDF, or HL7 messages.  
* Advanced filtering and matching rules to ensure only clinically relevant cases are routed to AI endpoints.  
* Customizable Job Actions to handle AI result re-ingestion, HL7 alerts, or smart routing to consultants.

### **3\. Smart Prior Retrieval**

* Automatically retrieves prior studies based on MWL, HL7, or RESTful triggers, optimized for NHS PACS configurations.  
* Context-aware retrieval: filters priors by body part, modality, adjacency, and age of exam.  
* Retention policies ensure transient caching to align with NHS data governance guidelines.

### **4\. NHS IT and Security Compliance**

* Native support for TLS 1.2/1.3, encrypted HL7, Active Directory/LDAP, and auditable role-based access control.  
* End-to-end audit logging for every action, message, and routing event, aligned with DICOM PS3.15 security standards.  
* Designed for high-availability and failover-ready installations, including support for Windows Server clusters.

## **üì¶ Packaging & Licensing**

* Available in Base, Enterprise, and AI-Enhanced editions.  
* Perpetual or annual license models available for NHS procurement.  
* Site-based pricing to fit within NHS Trust budget structures.

---

## **üìû Support & Services**

* Backed by Laurel Bridge‚Äôs Tier-3 support team with NHS project experience.  
* Optional onboarding packages, site assessments, and custom HL7/DICOM mapping services.  
* Regular software updates with support for NHS LTS (Long-Term Support) Windows platforms.

**Use Cases**

## **1\. AI Triage for Emergency Radiology Cases**

### ***Use Case: AI-Driven Prioritisation of Chest X-rays in A\&E***

**Scenario:**  
An NHS Trust A\&E department receives a high volume of chest X-rays, many of which require urgent attention (e.g., suspected pneumothorax or pulmonary embolism).

**How Laurel Bridge Helps:**

* Automatically routes CXR exams from A\&E to an AI inference engine upon acquisition.  
* Applies DICOM filters (modality \= CR/DR, body part \= Chest, source \= A\&E).  
* AI-generated structured reports are ingested, and critical findings (e.g., high confidence pneumothorax) trigger escalation workflows.  
* HL7 messages or SMS/email alerts are sent to on-call radiologists or consultants.

**Outcome:**  
Faster triage of critical cases improves clinical response time, patient safety, and supports 24/7 diagnostic services.

## **2\. Smart Prior Retrieval for Oncology Follow-Up**

### ***Use Case: Automatically Fetch Relevant Priors for MDT Reviews***

**Scenario:**  
Patients undergoing cancer treatment require regular imaging reviews. Radiologists need historical scans to evaluate disease progression.

**How Laurel Bridge Helps:**

* On receiving a new oncology CT exam (via MWL or HL7 trigger), Laurel Bridge retrieves relevant priors (e.g., last 12 months, same body part).  
* Filters priors based on anatomy, modality, or referrer.  
* Delivers the new study and selected priors to the reporting workstation or PACS in one unified job.

**Outcome:**  
Saves radiologists time, reduces manual search errors, and ensures better diagnostic accuracy for MDT meetings and follow-up reviews.

## **3\. AI Result Integration and Data Governance**

### ***Use Case: Structured AI Outputs as DICOM SR into PACS***

**Scenario:**  
Trusts deploying AI (e.g., stroke detection or mammography CAD) often receive results in PDFs or external formats.

**How Laurel Bridge Helps:**

* Intercepts AI results and maps them to DICOM SR or PDF Encapsulated objects.  
* Inserts these into the correct patient/study folder in PACS using HL7 mapping and accession number reconciliation.  
* Supports anonymisation or tagging for research, audit, or QA initiatives.

**Outcome:**  
Enables clean and standards-compliant integration of AI results into the existing NHS infrastructure and audit trail, essential for governance and clinical documentation.

## **4\. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity**

### ***Use Case: Seamless Routing to Offsite VNA During PACS Downtime***

**Scenario:**  
A Trust‚Äôs PACS is undergoing planned maintenance or experiences unplanned downtime.

**How Laurel Bridge Helps:**

* Monitors PACS availability using heartbeat sensing.  
* On failure, Laurel Bridge automatically reroutes incoming DICOM exams to an offsite VNA or backup PACS.  
* Sends HL7 notifications to RIS or staff indicating temporary redirection.

**Outcome:**  
Ensures zero-interruption diagnostic services, data integrity, and reduces manual intervention during outages.

## **5\. Outsourced and Night Hawk Reporting**

### ***Use Case: Conditional Routing for After-Hours Radiology Services***

**Scenario:**  
During overnight shifts or weekends, NHS Trusts often rely on teleradiology providers for out-of-hours coverage.

**How Laurel Bridge Helps:**

* Based on schedule and trigger conditions (e.g., 6 PM‚Äì8 AM, modality \= CT Head, location \= ED), Laurel Bridge routes exams to an external teleradiology service.  
* Ensures return of reports or structured data into the Trust‚Äôs RIS/PACS automatically.  
* Supports secure DICOM transmission over TLS and patient data logging for IG compliance.

Outcome:  
 Facilitates safe, efficient outsourcing without sacrificing control, compliance, or traceability.
